# Password-Generator-Project
A project to modify code to create a basic password generator.

## Description
This project requiered the user to be able to imput a password length between 8 and 128 characters and select between 4 password character options.
These options are lowercase and uppercase letters, numbers and special characters.
When the "Generate Password" button is pressed, a series of prompts will take the user through these options, only allowing for valid responses, redirecting the user if the submit an invalid one.
Once valid options are submitted, a randomized password with the user's specifications will appear in the box.
